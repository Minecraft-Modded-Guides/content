# Welcome to the Minecraft Guides

Using Github we are able to update and edit each guide without having to take each guide offline! This also allows other GitHub users to add updates to each guide whether it be corrections or updates. This also allows us to save older versions of each guide as an archive.

Using githubs also enables us to have strict version control and makes it much simpler to communicate changes with everyone.

Every page and image from each guides website is here!

## How to edit files
Editing guides and having your changes be accepted is relatively simple and can be done by anyone who has a GitHub account.

We will always give you details on why your request has been denied.

### [Editing Files With Github](https://help.github.com/en/articles/editing-files-in-another-users-repository)


## Folder Layout
There are 3 types of file extension that are allowed: .HTML, .txt and .MD format (more details on MarkDown can be found [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)).

Each mod has its own Folder. Any images that are attached to each page are within the folder of the page.

>The folder name is the same than the page content file
{.is-info}

Page name are in lowercase with hyphen like that worda-worb-wordc. You can also add digits if needed for more understanding.
